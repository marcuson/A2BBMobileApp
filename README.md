# A2BBMobileApp

This project is part of a bigger one, namely Angular 2 Beyond Browser (A2BB), and it is a mobile app made with [Ionic 2](http://ionic.io/2) which is basically used to identify a trusted device of the A2BB system.

The projects which are part of A2BB are:
* [A2BBServer](https://github.com/marcuson/A2BBServer)
* [A2BBAdminApp](https://github.com/marcuson/A2BBAdminApp)
* [A2BBUserSPA](https://github.com/marcuson/A2BBUserSPA)
* [A2BBMobileApp](https://github.com/marcuson/A2BBMobileApp)
* [A2BBGranter](https://github.com/marcuson/A2BBGranter)

and they have been developed as a demo to show the potentials of Angular2 - ASP.NET Core - Arduino technologies during a TechItalian meetup
(see [event here](https://www.meetup.com/TechItaliaTuscany/events/237721715)).

For an A2BB system description, please see [A2BBServer](https://github.com/marcuson/A2BBServer).
